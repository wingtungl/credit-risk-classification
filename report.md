## Overview of the Analysis

In this challenge, we evaluated logistic regression model based on the loan risk data. We processed the dataset as imbalanced and oversampled. In our dataset, there are two types of loan, which are healthy loan  and high-risk loan, we will evaluation the prediction creditworthiness result based on the high risk and healthy loan data using imbalanced data fit logistic regression model and oversampled fit lgoisitc regression model.

## Results

Imbalanced Sample:
- Healthy Loan :
    Accuracy: 99%
    Precision: 90%
    Recall: 99%

-High Risk Loan:
    Accuracy: 99%
    Precision: 85%
    Recall: 91%

Oversampled:
-Healthy Loan: 
    Accuracy: 99%
    Precision: 100%
    Recall: 99%

-High Risk Loan:
    Accuracy: 99%
    Precision: 84%
    Recall: 99%


## Summary

Both method has high accuracy and high precision on healthy loan. I would recommend the oversampled logisitc regression model because its precision for healthy loan is even higher than imbalanced sample fit logisitc regression model.
